SNAKE for GBA
=============

This is a simple snake clone for the Nintendo GBA handheld.

Instructions
------------

Use the directional pad to steer your cyan snake, avoid hitting your snake's head onto its body, and also avoid the edges of the screen.

Eat the magenta fruits to grow your snake further and further.

If you see a red block on the top left corner of the screen with the rest of the screen being black, then you have collided into yourself or the edge of the screen, causing a game-over. Restart the game by holding the right and left triggers.
